Abraham OT Maps are 100% free! And should be credited to Jeffro@OtLand.

If you are looking for custom pieces, you can ask me on OtLand, but as of now my time is very limited and pieces would take some time, not rushed.

I do accept donations! I don't request or require them. You can get more information from me by PM at Otland.

I'd also like to thank you for viewing my work and using it! And again, all I ask is you do refer to here for credit!

Enjoy~
