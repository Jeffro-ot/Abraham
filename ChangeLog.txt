Nutopia 10.77 Remake Evolution Styled RPG
Custom TFS 1.2
Developed by Jeffro@OtLand.net

----
------DESCRIPTION
----

Game progression developed around the use/find of unique weapons and armor.
There are 9 ranks for each individual weapon and armor which you can find
randomly from monsters or quests. Bosses will drop gems to further your
equipment and make you even stronger. You will progress finding new ways
to deal even more damage. Warrior's can progress their magic abilities finding
new damage spells and healing abilites, from throwing your weapon,
to AoE berserker spells, and % on block healing your health. A wide variety
of approaches you can take with your Warrior, not just a brute to take all the damage.
I've removed other vocations and left the warrior so I could focus primarily
on one vocation and make it fit the system and not be over powered.

With Warrior Abilities, Spell Combo's = Less Exhaustion

Any PvP will be adjusted once the PvE aspect of the game is finished for the warrior.
